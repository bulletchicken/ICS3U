# Summative Outline
Little Tammy has lost her pet turtle â€“ Timo. Timo is lost in a grid and you will need to try to find him in as
few moves as possible. He starts in a random location and can move randomly 1 space each turn. You need
to find him and return him to the starting spot without getting caught by your parents.
